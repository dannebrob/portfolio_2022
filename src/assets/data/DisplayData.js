      "A coffee ordering app. The final project of a React and Redux course. With drone delivery.",
    text: "This was the final big project in the React course, by Folkuniverisitetet and ZooCom. It summed up most of the course syllabus. The project was a great hands-on project with React, Redux, React Router and API calls. A lot of focus was also on problem-solving and decision-making, since the rules of the project were not predefined. After the project, I feel that lots of the concepts of React and Redux were solidified and tested my ability to find my own solutions.",

    text: "A big project, built closely with the business owner. First, I made a mockup in Figma and after feedback from the client, we found a design that was appealing and easy to use for the end-user. A big challenge for me to make a WordPress theme from scratch that would work with all possible plugins and other add-ons that could be used in the future. To organize the input from my client and upcoming tasks I used a Trello board, a great tool for visualization.",

    text: "A great hobby project that really had no boundaries. I wanted to build it with react since I liked the component based way to build the site. I wanted to use the React Context API for state management, since I had used Redux before and wanted to try it out. This will most certainly be a project that I keep on working with, since there's a lot of features I would love to add.",
